# eulerJava
Repo to hold java solutions to projecteuler problems, to learn Java

Files are mostly just what I copy/pasted into jshell


# NOTE
If you're in this repo I'm assuming you're doing so to judge me. That's cool.

But if you're here to crib solutions then you're only robbing yourself of the skill growth. For shame.
