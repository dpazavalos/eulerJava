# eulerJava
Repo to hold java solutions to project euler problems, to learn Java

https://projecteuler.net/archives

Code is copied from a workspace where Main.java is the only source file. Hosted file names reference their euler questions



# NOTE
If you're in this repo to judge my work, that's cool

If you're here to crib solutions, for shame. You're only robbing yourself.
