/**
 * Question:
 *  The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
 *  The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
 *  Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the
 *  square of the sum is
 *  3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
 *
 *  Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and
 *  the square of the sum.
 *
 * Solution
 *  For loops. Literally just two four loops in a dedicated class
